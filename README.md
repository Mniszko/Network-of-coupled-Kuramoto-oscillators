# Network-of-coupled-Kuramoto-oscillators

### Repository Structure

**feed-forward_MNIST_example** contains code for feed-forward, fully connected NN (functions, structs and whatelse in Julia language) alongside training and inference code. Running the notebook requires mnist dataset to be located in *< notebook's directory >/mnist/*.

It pains me I won't apply ADAM algorithm to optimize learning rate throughout this dataset, but I shall not approach this problem before dealing with my main task.

**main.ipynb** contains graph based python simulation of kuramoto oscillator networks.
